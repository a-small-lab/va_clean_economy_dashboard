"Notes: Data are shown for All Sectors. Full Service Providers sell bundled electricity services (e.g., both energy and delivery)   to end users. Full Service Providers may purchase electricity from others (such as independent Power Producers or other full service providers) prior to delivery.   Other Providers sell either the energy or the delivery services, but not both. Sales volumes and customer counts shown for Other Providers refer to delivered electricity,   which is a joint activity of both energy and delivery providers; for clarity, they are reported only in the Energy column in this table.The revenue shown under Other Providers represents the revenue realized from the sale of the energy and the delivery services distinctly. ""Public"" entities include municipalities,   State power agencies, and municipal marketing authorities.  Federal entities are either owned or financed by the Federal Government. ""Cooperatives"" are electric utilities   legally established to be owned by and operated for the benefit of those using its services. The cooperative will generate, transmit and/or distribute supplies of electric energy   to a specified area not being serviced by another utility. ""Non-utility"" sales represent direct electricity transactions from independent generators to end use consumers.   Totals may not equal sum of components because of independent rounding.
Total number of entities are not summed for the state to prevent possible duplication.
